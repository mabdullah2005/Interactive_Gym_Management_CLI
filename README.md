# Interactive Gym Management System

- A command-line based Gym Management System built using Java, with a focus on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and CRUD operations.

## Timeline: January 2025 (End of first semester, first year solo project)

## Project Description:

The Interactive Gym Management System manages gym members’ training and health data using a real-world dataset. A dataset containing 900+ gym member records was imported from Kaggle to simulate real-world database usage.

### The application allows users to efficiently:

- Search and filter member records

- Analyze health metrics

- Perform full database operations

## Technologies Used:

- **Java**

## Dataset

**Source**: Kaggle

**Size**: 900+ records

### Data Includes:

- Training activity details

- Health-related attributes

- Calorie expenditure data

- BMI-related values

## Features

- **Advanced Database Lookup**: Search records using 7 different field filters

- **BMI Analyzer**: Calculates and evaluates BMI using stored health data

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update and delete member records

- **View existing data**

- **Top 5 Members by Calories Burned**: Retrieves and displays top performers (Implemented using the Quick Sort algorithm for efficient sorting)

## How to Run

- Clone the repository

- Open the project in a Java IDE or terminal

- Compile and run the main Java file

- Follow the command-line prompts to interact with the system

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience working with a large, real-world dataset

### Improved understanding of:

- Algorithm efficiency and sorting techniques

- Database-style record management

- Java-based CLI application development

- Applied theoretical DSA concepts in a functional project

## Project Timeline

- **January 2025** (End of First Semester – First Year solo project)
