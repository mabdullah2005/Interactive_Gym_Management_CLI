Interactive Gym Management System

A command-line based Gym Management System built using Java, focusing on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and CRUD operations.
This project was developed as an end-of-first-semester university project (January 2025).

Project Description:

The system manages gym members’ training and health data using a real-world dataset. It allows users to efficiently search, analyze, and manipulate records through a command-line interface.

An external dataset containing 900+ gym member records was imported from Kaggle, simulating real-world database operations.

Technologies Used:

Java

Data Structures & Algorithms

CRUD Operations

Command Line Interface (CLI)

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle

Records: 900+ gym members

Data includes training and health-related attributes such as calorie expenditure and BMI-related values

Features:

Database Lookup: Search records using 7 different field filters

BMI Analyzer: Calculates and analyzes BMI for gym members

CRUD Operations: Add, view, update, and delete member records

Top 5 Members by Calories Burned: Implemented using the Quick Sort algorithm for efficient sorting

Algorithms Implemented:

Quick Sort: Used to rank members based on calories burned

How to Run:

Clone the repository

Open the project in a Java IDE or terminal

Compile and run the main Java file

Interact with the system via the command line prompts

Timeline:

January 2025 (End of First Semester – First Year Solo Project)
